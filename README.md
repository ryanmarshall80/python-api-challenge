Ryan Marshall Homework 6 for Python APIs

There should one jupyter notebook source file in each of the two folders: "WeatherPy" and "VacationPy". These contain the code that I created to solve this homework. In addition, the "WeatherPy" folder should contain a csv file titled "CityWeather" that contains an export of the data I received from the weather api. The "VacationPy" folder also includes two screenshots, one of the map with the humidity layer on top, and another that has hotel info overlaid on top of that.
